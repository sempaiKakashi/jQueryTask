	<h2>My favourite framework is React,js</h2>
	<p>In computing, React (sometimes React.js or ReactJS) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook, Instagram and a community of individual developers and corporations. React can be used in the development of single-page applications and mobile applications. It aims primarily to provide speed, simplicity, and scalability. As a user interface library, React is often used in conjunction with other libraries such as Redux.</p>
